1. Introduction
Digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) are transforming global markets by offering new opportunities for trading, yield, and interoperability. However, most assets are tied to existing fiat pegs or legacy models. Europa Coin (EURC) seeks to fill the gap as a flexible, market-driven utility token that is accessible, transparent, and community-oriented.
